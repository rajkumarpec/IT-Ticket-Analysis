# IT-Ticket-Analysis
### Power BI Project Description Create a Power BI dashboard to analyze and improve the performance, efficiency, and customer satisfaction of the IT help desk using detailed ticketing system data.



### Overview

The dataset includes detailed information about each ticket, such as the requester, department, severity, priority, and duration of the ticket, along with satisfaction ratings. This information can be used to create a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that provides insights into the performance of the IT help desk, identifies areas for improvement, and helps in decision-making.

### Project Objectives
1. Monitor the IT help desk's performance in resolving tickets, handling severity levels, and maintaining customer satisfaction.
2. Analyze ticket distribution across departments and IT owners to identify workload imbalances and optimize resource allocation.
